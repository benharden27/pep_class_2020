      <description>Reading You should read Sections 3.1 to 3.6 (and skim the rest) of Chapter 3 of R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This should introduced you to the basic ideas behind ggplot and helped you create your first plots using their built-in data. ggplot is a powerful tool for producing elegant graphics and is relatively simple to use once you’ve mastered a few key ideas.</description>

      <description>Our goal in learning R is to introduce you to some skills in exploring oceanographic data in R. This will mainly involve plotting tools, but will also include some discussion of working with data sets.
Why R? Perhaps the best place to start is to ask ourselves why we are choosing to use R. Fortunately, Rob Schlegel (WHOI) sums up nicely why using R is a good idea for data science as part of his R workshop.</description>
