<h1>Why R?</h1>
<p>Perhaps the best place to start is to ask ourselves why we are choosing to use R. Fortunately, Rob Schlegel (WHOI) sums up nicely why using R is a good idea for data science as part of his R workshop. Please read <a href="https://robwschlegel.github.io/Intro_R_Workshop/prelim.html#why-use-r">this</a>.</p>
<p>Dan Kelley (Dalhousie) has a nice book on oceanographic analysis in R - his sub-chapter on <a href="/docs/Kelley_whyR.pdf">“Why R, and Why Now?”</a> is a quick read to help contextualize the desire to use R for oceanographic work.</p>
<p>Please read both these short justifications to give you an insight into why R is something worth your energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-r-and-rstudio" class="section level1">
<h1>Downloading R and Rstudio</h1>
<p>You should next download both R (the programming language) and Rstudio (a nice visual interface that makes writing code more intuitive) and opened RStudio to see that it has worked properly.</p>
<p>You need to download R first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" class="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</a> and choose “download R” under “Getting Started”.</li>
<li>Select any of the sites to download R from</li>
<li>Choose the R link for your operating system</li>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: select “base” and then “Download R for Windows”. Run the .exe file that you download to install R</li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>: select the .pkg link to download. Run the file that you download to install.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you need to download RStudio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com</a></li>
<li>Click “Download RStudio” and following the instructions for your operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use R you need to open RStudio (not the R link that might have appeared on your desktop).</p>
</div>
<div id="intro-to-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Intro to R</h1>
<p>If you’ve never used R or RStudio before it’s worth a little bit of orientation.</p>
<p>You can get some basics from this tutorial:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1/" class="uri">https://www.udemy.com/course/machlearn1/</a></p>
<p>You will need to sign in. Go through the “Getting Started” section (&lt; 20mins) to get the real basics.</p>
