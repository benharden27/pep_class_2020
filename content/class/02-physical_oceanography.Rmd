# Temperature, Salinity and Density

Physical Oceanography is the study of how water moves. This includes ocean currents, waves and large scale ocean circulation. Some of the most fundimental ideas revolve around the key physical properties of the water: Temperature, Salinity and Density. We will explore these properties and how they allow or limit movement of water in the ocean.

## Individual Work

### Prep-work

Read the following from [Segar](https://www.reefimages.com/oceansci.php):

- [Chapter 1](https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap01.pdf): Introduction (pg. 1-2); The Oceans and Earth's Environment (pg. 2-6). These sections are less explicitly about physical oceanography, but provide a good overview and motivation for studying the ocean.
- [Critical Concepts](https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4CritCon.pdf) 1 and 6. These cover the key ideas that relate temperature and salinity (and pressure) to density

### Exercise

#Q1: How does temperature and salinity vary accross the surface ocean?

Temperature and salinity are largely changed in the surface ocean.

Temperature is changed via:

- Heating from the sun
- Cooling from the winds

Salinity is changed via:

- Freshening from rain or river input
- Increasing salinity due to evaporation

Let's take temperature first. The following image show the average surface temperature of the world's oceans.

**Questions**

> In general, how does temperature vary as you go from the south pole to the north pole? Where is it highest? Lowest?

> How does this relate to your understanding of how much incoming heat from the sun the earth recieves?

> What parts of the oceans don't fit your general trend?

Now to salinity. Below is the same map as above, but for global surface salinity values. Red colors are saltier parts of the ocean, blue colors are fresher water.

And this image below shows an idealized distribution of precipatation (rainfall) in blue and evaporation in red

The evaporation curve is similar to the incoming radiation curve - more heating from the sun leads to move evaporation from the surface.

**Questions**

> Describe the shape of the evaporation curve? What causes it to be shaped this way? HINT: consider the climates on land at the highs and lows of this plot.

> In which regions is precipatation greater than evaporation?

> How does this pattern help us understand the general trends in sea surface salinity seen above?
