<p>Physical Oceanography is the study of how water moves. This includes ocean currents, waves and large scale ocean circulation. Some of the most fundimental ideas revolve around the key physical properties of the water: Temperature, Salinity and Density. We will explore these properties and how they allow or limit movement of water in the ocean.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Reading</h1>
<p>Read the following from <a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceansci.php">Segar</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap01.pdf">Chapter 1</a>: Introduction (pg. 1-2); The Oceans and Earth’s Environment (pg. 2-6). These sections are less explicitly about physical oceanography, but provide a good overview and motivation for studying the ocean.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4Chap07.pdf">Chapter 7</a>:
+ Climate and Ocean Surface Water Properties (pg. Water and Heat Budgets (pg. 147-149). This covers the input and removal of heat and water from the ocean.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean4CritCon.pdf">Critical Concepts</a> 1 and 6. These cover the key ideas that relate temperature and salinity (and pressure) to density</li>
</ul>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Exercises</h1>
<p>Remember, these questions are meant to help you puzzle out some patterns. We will discuss everything in peer groups and in class. Please note your responses in the exercise assignment (ungraded).</p>
<div id="surface-temperature-and-salinity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Surface temperature and salinity</h2>

<div id="depth-profiles-from-around-the-world" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Depth profiles from around the world</h2>
<p>The following image shows five vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and density from around the world. These were all taken from a ship using a CTD at locations shown on the map below. I have labelled all the profiles and shown you all the positions, but I haven’t joined the dots.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your first challenge is to use the WOCE surface temperature and salinity maps (above) to match the profiles up to their locations based on the surface temperature and salinities in the profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>Which profile/regions have the strongest and weakest pyconoclines? Why?</p></li>
