<p>Physical Oceanography is the study of how water moves. This includes ocean currents, waves and large scale ocean circulation. Some of the most fundimental ideas revolve around the key physical properties of the water: Temperature, Salinity and Density. We will explore these properties and how they allow or limit movement of water in the ocean.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> How we measure Temperature and Salinity</h3>
<p>The basic tool for measuring the temperature and salinity of the ocean is the <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/explore/instruments/instruments-sensors-samplers/conductivity-temperature-depth-ctd-sensors/">CTD</a> (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) device which we lower from the side of a ship to record a vertical trace (or profile) of the ocean.</p>

<p>Remember, these questions are meant to help you puzzle out some patterns. We will discuss everything in peer groups and in class. Please note your responses in the exercise assignment (ungraded).</p>
<div id="exercise-1-surface-temperature-and-salinity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Exercise 1: Surface temperature and salinity</h3>
<p>Except for a few specific environments (such as deep-sea vents), temperature and salinity are changed solely in the surface ocean.</p>
<p>Temperature is changed via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heating from the sun’s shortwave radiation</li>
<li>Cooling from the ocean’s longwave radiation</li>
<li>Cooling from a wind colder than the surface</li>
</ul>
<p>Salinity is changed via:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshening from rain or river input</li>
<li>Increasing salinity due to evaporation - the salt is left behind when the water is evaporated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take temperature first. The following image show the average surface temperature of the world’s oceans.</p>
<p><img src="/images/woce_surf_temp.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In general, how does temperature vary as you go from the south pole to the north pole? Where is it highest? Lowest?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this relate to your understanding of how much incoming heat from the sun the earth recieves?</p></li>
<li><p>What parts of the oceans don’t fit your general trend?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now to salinity. Below is the same map as above, but for global surface salinity values. Red colors are saltier parts of the ocean, blue colors are fresher water.</p>
<p><img src="/images/woce_surf_sal.png" /></p>
<p>And this image below shows an idealized distribution of precipatation (rainfall) in blue and evaporation in red</p>
<p><img src="/images/precip_evap.jpg" /></p>
<p>The evaporation curve is similar to the incoming radiation curve - more heating from the sun leads to move evaporation from the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe the shape of the evaporation curve? What causes it to be shaped this way? HINT: consider the climates on land at the highs and lows of this plot.</p></li>
<li><p>In which regions is precipatation greater than evaporation?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this pattern help us understand the general trends in sea surface salinity seen above?</p></li>
</ul>
