# Exercises

## Vertical Distribution of Chlorophyll

Below are typical vertical profiles of light and nutrients in the ocean.

!p[(/images/light_nutrients.jpg)

* Q: Describe the patterns that you see in each - why do they behave the way they do?
* Q: Given that phytoplankton need both light and nutrients to grow, can you hyptothesize the vertical distribution of phytoplankton for these profiles?

## Seasonal Cycle

We saw in our class on Temperture and Salinity, that the mixed-layer at mid-latitudes increases in depth during the winter due to strong, cold winds, before shoaling in the spring and into the summer when a strong thermocline (pycnocline) is developed.

* Q: How do you think this will affect the availability of nutrients in the surface water over the course of the year?

Below is some data from the [Ocean Observatories Initiative](https://oceanobservatories.org/), a massive undertaking to collect data from around the globe throughout the year. Shown in the three plots are surface concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, Oxygen, and Nitrate from summer 2018 to summer 2019.

```{r}
ts <- read_csv("data/ooi.csv")
ctd <- read_csv("data/ctd.csv") %>%
  filter(dep <= 1000)

vars<-c(fluorometric_chlorophyll_a="Chlorophyll-a (mg/L)",
        dissolved_oxygen="Dissolved Oxygen (umol/kg)",
        nitrate_concentration="Nitrate (umol/L)")

ggplot(ts,aes(time,value))+
  geom_point(size = .3) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(key,names(vars)),ncol=1,scales="free_y",strip.position = "left",labeller=as_labeller(vars))+
  labs(x=NULL,y=NULL)+
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks="2 months", date_labels=("%m/%y"))+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(strip.placement = "outside",
        strip.background = element_blank())
```

* Q: How does the seasonal cycle in nitrate compare with your prediction above?
* Q: Describe the seasonal cycle in phytoplankton growth - How does this relate to the seasonal cycle in oxygen?

## Where are the phytoplankton?

Below is a satellite map of surface chlorophyll

![NASA](/images/surface_phyto.jpg)

Yellows and reds indicate more chlorophyll and blues and purples less. This is the average amount recorded over many years of satellite observations.

* Q: What patterns do you observe? Where is chlorophyll generally higher and lower?
* Q: What suggestions do you have for these patterns?





## HNLC

The following is a map of surface nitrate concentrations.

![](/images/limiting_nuts.jpg)

Light blue colors are low nitrate concentrations, and green colors are high concentrations. Superimposed on the image are circles for where researchers went to sample the ocean. At each point they took a sample of seawater and added different nutrients to see which would make the phytoplankton grow quickest. This is a way to determine which nutrient is currently in shortest supply relative to what the plankton need.  This is known as the __limiting nutrient__, a nutrient which limits te growth of phytoplankton even if others are in high-supply.

There are typically two limiting nutrients in the ocean - Nitrogen (in the form of Nitrate NO_3^2^-) and Iron. The locations where phytoplankton are iron limited are shown with red dots and those that are nitrogen limited are shown with green dots.

* Q: How do the distribution of red and green dots map to the underlying distribution of nitrate? Does this make sense?

Much of the iron in the ocean comes from depisiton from winds blown over desserts. Below is a map of average dust deposition across the whole planet.

* Q: Which parts of the nutrient-limited map can be explained due to the lack of proximity to land sources of iron? Which can't and why?
